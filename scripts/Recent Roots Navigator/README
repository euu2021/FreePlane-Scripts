I created a script that allows navigating between recent View Roots (i.e., roots created when a Jump In is used).

## Why: 
some months ago, I learned the productivity tip of not using tabs, and use, instead, a "recent places" navigator. It's explained, for example, [at this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND0Br0jMl7M) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kDMr5SGBBc). I've been using it in the IDE, and I find it way more efficient than using tabs. So, I brought it to FreePlane.

## How it works:
After using a Jump In, a new root view is created. After this, I can go back to this root view (i.e., recreate it) by activating the script. 

In this example, I Jump In in nodes aaa and bbb, so when I activate the script, they are in the list of recent roots:

Also, it saves the node that was selected when I navigated between roots. For example, If I navigated to bbb when aaa2 was selected, if I go back to root aaa, the navigator will go back to aaa2:

![java_WjE9XMgUbg](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/374f1300-9c5e-4366-916f-0826de821e9b)

In the first line it shows the root text, and the second line shows the text of the node that will actually be selected (which is the node that was selected in the last time that this root was active):

## How to use it:
Two scripts are needed. 
- place both scripts of https://github.com/euu2021/FreePlane-Scripts/tree/main/scripts/Recent%20Roots%20Navigator in the scripts folder;
- assign script 1 to a hotkey that uses the Ctrl key (I use Ctrl+Tab), and script 2 to the key that you want for the Jump In action (I use Tab);
- To navigate between the recent roots, use the script 1 hotkey. Use Ctrl+Tab or Ctrl+Shift+Tab to navigate the list items;
- Release the Ctrl key to navigate to the selected item.
